## Introduction

This repository includes all data models, prototypes and for decision-making relevant use cases from the cloud providers (for milestone one and two). The goal of this workgroup is to produce a technical and contentual concept of the OIH. Therefore, the master data schemes and meta models are developed, resulting in the definition of the new standards which makes it possible to sync and map data between all applications.
