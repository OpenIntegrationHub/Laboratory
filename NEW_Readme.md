## Introduction

This repository includes all data models, prototypes and for decision-making relevant use cases from the cloud providers (for milestone one and two). The goal of this workgroup is to produce a technical and contentual concept of the OIH. Therefore, the master data schemes and meta models are developed, resulting in the definition of the new standards which makes it possible to sync and map data between all applications. 

## Folders

- The meta data model and the scheme definition language can be found in the folder „DataModels“
- The master data model, the three adapters „silverp“, „snazzy“, „wice“ and their actions and triggers are defined in the folder „MasterDataModels“
- Additionally, there is a folder containing the workgroup telcos‘ protocols
- The folder „scr“ includes the schemes in JSON


## Documents

- Decisions regarding the data and domain model are gathered in the „DecisionsMade“ document
- Any rule considering contributing can be found in the „contribution guideline“
- „MilestoneOne“ contains the permanent links towards the generic data models
- „MilestoneTwo“ includes the goals from the second milestone


## Workgroup Information

- Each workgroup has atleast one status call every two weeks
- Every comitter must attend the status call
- The governance model defines the workgroup members roles into managers, committers or contributors
