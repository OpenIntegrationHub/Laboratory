## Outcome
Agreement on our workload for this quarter (Q4)

## Topics (issues)

### Feedback tool onboarding @all [quick session]
**Purpose:**<br>
* Feedback about GitHub & ZenHub
<br>=> Commitment to tool chain

**Discussion:**<br>

_Raphael_:<br>
- GitHub serves as an instance to document findings/results
- The documentation on GitHub aims to foster the collaboration within the project
- Creating issues can help, e.g. to reveal obstacles and solve them together with other project participants
- Tickets/Issues evolve over time - it is a revolutionary process

_Josef_:<br>
- Time issue -> Although only 5 'person days' per week are calculated, 5 people work on the project 
- Until this meeting, direct communication- instead of communication via GitHub -  was chosen to avoid a waste of time
- **Missing feeling for the granularity of the issues/tickets on GitHub**
- Missing expectations of the other project participants about the issues/tickets hampered the use
- An update call (one every two weeks) is sufficient enough to get an overarching overview
- Intermediate-term scope is missing, but should not be as granular as the short-term scope in the Stand Up Calls every two weeks
- **Shares Lutz' opinion, that the is sufficient enough to describe findings/results on GitHub**


_Lutz_:<br>
- Documentation should describe: _What is it?_ and _What is it good for?_
- The effort is to high because of the great amount of tools (including tools from other projects)
- **The issue creation to this point is to granular, it is sufficient enough to document the findings/results**
- Coordination between teams working on the same topic works by itself
- **Granularity of tickets/issues is missing**
- GitHubs focus should lie on _what is in progress?_, _what should be done_, _what and how was something done?_. Means i.e. the internal communication takes place on GitHub and the reporting for the DLR is detached from this.

_Igor_:<br>
- Contradicting opinion: Through the documentation is an overviewcreated, which enhances the collaboration and helps to make the project successful. Documentation is essentiel.
- Obstacles can not be detected without the documentation (and therefore can not be solved)
- **Agrees to use GitHub / ZenHub and mark-down**
- Elastic.io has not used GitHub to this point because of their internal coordination
- Learning: Collaboration with different teams is much harder than expected,
- Provided a first approach regarding the Data Hub concepts (See topic "Data Hub Concept - suggested by @igor")


_Stephan:_<br>
- **Finding: The way and granularity of contributing on GitHub has to be clarified**

### Working with GitHub & ZenHub @raphael [quick session]
**Purpose:**<br>
* Create an item (issue)
<br>=> New issue example

**Discussion:**<br>
- No need to create an issue during this meeting (Common sense)

### Committee of innovation @all [quick session]
**Purpose:**<br>
* What's your expectation / understanding?<br>
=> Common sense about our committee.

**Discussion:**<br>
- In the innovation committee new ideas and innovations regarding the OIH are discussed
- Distinction between persons which produce no (or only few) code (mainly conceptual work) and person which produce the majority of code


### Your contribution @all [be prepared] [openintegrationhub/innovation#1](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/innovation/issues/1)
**Purpose:**<br>
- Innovation topics, market trends etc.<br> 
=> Agenda for the rest of the day

**Discussion:**<br>

_Data Hub Concept - suggested by @igor_ <br>
-  During the meeting the functions of the [Prototype TIER 2](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/innovation/issues/2) were discussed. Through this discussion the tasks at the end of this protocol are derived.

_Schema Definition Language @raphael_ <br>
- To Be Done (TBD)

_Standard to describe API Design @renat_ <br>
- TBD

_Standard for API Documentation @renat_ <br>
- TBD

_Standard to describe Metamodels @renat_ <br>
- TBD

_Contribution within the project (e.g. GitHub) @philipp_ <br>
- TBD

## Derived Tasks
- The [Prototype TIER 2](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/innovation/issues/2) issue will be revised and will result in an issue for both, the **protoype TIER 1** and the **prototype TIER 2**. @josef
- The [Integration Scenario with DataHub](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/architecture/blob/master/evaluations/dataIntegrationWithDataHub.md) is expanded, with the aim to make clear, which functionality the first and second iteration of the DataHub should provide (to every stakeholder). @igor  
 
## Next Meeting

- [x] **Host** - Cloud Ecosystem / X-Integrate
- [x] **Address** - X-Integrate, Im Mediapark 5c, 50670 Köln
