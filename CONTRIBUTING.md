## How to contribute

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Create a new .md file
2. Select _"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."_
3. Name the branch as follows: **FolderName-Topic**
4. Click on _"propose new file"_
5. Assign **at least one other person** to the pull request
6. Assign an appropiate label to the pull request
7. Click on _"create pull request"_

### Creating an Issue
For any issue, there are fundamentally two ways an individual can contribute:

 - By helping to triage the issue: This can be done either by providing supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing suggestions on how to address the issue.
 - By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in Open Integrationb Hub in a concrete and reviewable manner.

### Naming Conventions
Within this repository _upper_ `CamelCase` is used to name files (source code, assets, .md files, etc.). E.g. `AdapterGuide.md`
