## Introduction

This repository includes the master data models for products and addresses, early prototypes and for decision-making relevant use cases and user stories from the cloud provider. Additionally, there is the superordinated data model and the procedure model for data model versioning. Hence, it is possible to develop the master data model and the meta model to enable standardized data synchronization across all connected applications.
