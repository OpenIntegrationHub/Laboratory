## Introduction

The Open Integration Hub enables data synchronization across a variety of applications. This requires unified data structures — the master data models of the Open Integration Hub. Currently, there are models for the domains addresses and products. In addition, more are to be developed in the very near future, for example, the master data models for collaboration and documents. Therefore, we need you to help us grow as a community!
