## Introduction

The Open Integration Hub enables data synchronization across a variety of applications. This requires unified data structures — the master data models of the Open Integration Hub. Currently, there are models for the domains addresses and products. In addition, two more models for the domains collaboration and documents will follow soon. More models are to be developed in the very near future. To elaborate further models and to make the open integration hub even better - we need you! So join us and help us grow as an open source community!

## Content
#### Folders

- `Decisions`: This folder contains all outstanding/made decisions by the workgroup categorized by open and closed decisions
- `MasterDataModels`: This folder contains general information about the data models, an explanation of the OIHDataRecord and all currently existing master data models
- `Protocols`: Contains meeting protocols of the workgroup meetings
- `src`: All JSON schemes can be found here. This includes JSON schemes for all existing master data models, the overarching OIHDataRecord and a generic example as a starting point for writing JSON schemes for the relating data model


#### Documents

- `CONTRIBUTING`: Gathers any rule considering the contribution
- `Onboarding`: Describes how to proceed when developing a master data model and a connector. It lists the most important documents from the connectors repository and the data and domain models repository, to simplify the onboarding process.
