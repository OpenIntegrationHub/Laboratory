## Protocol

# Housekeeping
- Please make sure that the Workgroup Manager creates a protocol for every regular call
  - Template can be found under [protocol template](TEMPLATE.md)


## WorkgroupManger
- Hans was elected unanimously as the workgroup manager

# Scope
- History:
  - Derived from usecases: I want to create a dataset in a target system. Every dataset/resource has an owner. We need to transfer the owner
  - Basaas wants to create superordinated User/Tenants which need to be mapped to the owner of the datasets in the connected systems
  - User, Tenants & Right stucture is needed within Open Integration Hub
- Expectation Basaas: Derive UseCases/UserStories and start with a simple model that is iteratively expanded
- Expectation Wice: Adress model does explicit not cover rights
- Thoughts ELO: Central repository where Credentials are shared is a typical solution within integration scenarios
  - Central user mapping because everything else needs a lot of management effort
  - Creation of a 3rd party key for identifying the users across systems

- 3 dimensions of user, tenants, rights & groups

**Scope:** Focus on synchronizing tenants, user & groups    

## Next Steps
- [ ] Collection of UseCases & UserStories **Responsibility: All**
