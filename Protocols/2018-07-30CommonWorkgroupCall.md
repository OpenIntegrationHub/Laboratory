# Protocol

**Attendees:** Philipp, Elke, Andreas, Franz

## Protocol

# OIHDataRecord
- It likely that an additional "warpper" is needed e.g. "oihmessage"
- oihmessage would include the oihdatarecord and an oihheader 
- oihheader would include additional information such as a transactionId, a request time and possibly a "tenantID" (wording is not fix yet and needs to be revised)

# Conventions
- Do we allow elements & attributes? Discussion postponed to next meeting. Idea derived from XML.

--> No differentiation between elements and attributes in JSON schemas/objects. Therefore no need to decide on this question.

## Versioning
- Postponed

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create graphical overview of oihmessage and oihheader
