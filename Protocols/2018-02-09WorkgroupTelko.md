# Protocol

**Attendees:** Elke, Andy, Josef, Raphael **Guests:** Hansj√∂rg **Absent:** Andreas

## Workshop Protocol
* Unanimously adopted [2018-02-17Workgroup.md](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/blob/master/Protocols/2018-01-17Workshop.md)

## Updates on current state
* The [specialization](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/issues/43) of the standard data model (configuration) - derive procedure model for specialization (versioning)
	* **meta data** models
	* **domain data** models
		* address data model
			* **specialized** model
		* product data model
			* **specialized** model
		* permission data model (new since [MS2 planning workshop](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/blob/master/Protocols/2018-01-17Workshop.md#further-thoughts))
			* **specialized** model
* The [interfaces](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/issues/65#issuecomment-361860505) of the Smart Data Framework (SDF) - **standard** and **custom** data transmission between ISV-1/2/N
* The [survey](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/issues/68#issuecomment-364100972) to collect **data points** on actually transmitted data at integration scenarios - derive standard data

## Our asynchronous collaboration
* Document refinements/updates at the ticket descriptions. Separate later findings with dashes for us, as seen at [#68](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/issues/68)
* Share new results/progress in comments within that ticket. Explain changes to us, as seen at [#65](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Data-and-Domain-Models/issues/65)

## Contribution planning
* Prioritization of the tickets till the next regular call
