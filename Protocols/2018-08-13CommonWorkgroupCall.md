# Protocol

**Attendees:** Philipp, Elke, Andreas, Franz

## Protocol

# Versioning
- A graphical overview of the decision process workflow could help to get a quick overview of the process
- Thresholds for incorporating changes into a data model
  - Decisions should be made by Committer not by connected applications. Otherwise there would be a communication overhead and the process would take to long. 
- Decision process guidelines have to be more precise

# OihMessage
- OihMessage needs the oihMessage attribute changed into oihMessageHeader
- Modification object should be more generic
  - Split into "Actor", Type (Creation, Modification) and Timestamp

# Conventions
- Common attribute table must be revised to check whether it is appropriate or not

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create graphical overview of decision process workflow **andreas** 
- [ ] Change threshold table of decision process **philipp**
- [ ] Define decision process more precisely **philipp**
- [ ] Revise OIHMessage and Modification object **philipp**
- [ ] Review changes and additions from all 4 tasks above **all**
