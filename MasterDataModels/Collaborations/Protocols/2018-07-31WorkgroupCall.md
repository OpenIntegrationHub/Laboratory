## Protocol

# Feedback documentation: collaboration datamodel
- description table needs to be added
- additional realation from task to OIHDataRecord was added by Dennis, UML Diagram in GitHub needs to be updated
- JSON Schema is missing, will be added in a later step by Peter

## Discussion of the collaboration datamodel
- Patrick says that every e-mail should be seen as an action and not an element. This thought will be picked up for the second version of the colloboration datamodel.
- Agreement on a two step approach: first step will be the finalization of the current model, afterwards the documentation will be send to different partners to gather feedback. In the second step the gathered feedback will be discussed and the model will be altered.
- date can be deleted from the model, every OIHDataRecord has a property where the date will be saved.

## Next Steps
- [ ] add description table to documentation **Responsibility: Peter**
- [ ] send documentation to partners **Responsibility: Dennis**
- [ ] read documentation and comment **Responsibility: Patrick**
